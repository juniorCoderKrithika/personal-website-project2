            <p>I Love art and craft it is my favorite. I make art in my free time and craft on saturdays and sundays. It is kind of fun. I am 9 years 4th standard. I know art and craft improves our creativity like thinking of making a 3D submarine with paper and balloons.
                As I do art I get a good name in school for art and craft. It engages me and makes me feel good. I made a lot of art like a ship with a paper plate, wool, paper, termacol, 3 stickes(1 big, 2 small), scissors and glue This is how I did it -
                1st step - take the paper plate cut it into halve. 2nd step - stick the halves together. 3rd step - take the termacol and cut it in shape of the width of the ship, then tuck it in. 4th step - take the stickes and make sails, For the big one make two sails - one very big other according to the first one, for the other two small ones- according to the sticks. 5th step - stick the stickes on the termacol. 6th step - take wool and make an anchor with the waste pieces. 7th step - stick it on the ship and your ship is done.
